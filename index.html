                <p>first time I was homeless was when I went to Atlanta. I was in a homeless shelter, then when I got a
                    job I used to miss the curfew for the shelter. So I ended up sleeping outside in the streets.</p>

                    and cultures, to understand social and ethical norms for behavior, and to recognize family, school,
                    and
                    community resources and supports.</p>
