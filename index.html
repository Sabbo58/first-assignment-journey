            <p>Empathy is choosing to see ourselves in another despite our differences. <br>
                It's recognizing that the same humanity - the same desire for meaning,<br>
                fulfillment and security - exists in each of us.

                <p>first time I was homeless was when I went to Atlanta. I was in a homeless shelter, then when I got a
                    job I used to miss the curfew for the shelter. So I ended up sleeping outside in the streets.</p>

                <p>Social awareness is the ability to take the perspective of and empathize with others from diverse
                    backgrounds
                    and cultures, to understand social and ethical norms for behavior, and to recognize family, school,
                    and
                    community resources and supports.</p>
